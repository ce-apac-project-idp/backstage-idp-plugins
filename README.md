# The Plugins Folder

This is where your own plugins and their associated modules live, each in a
separate folder of its own.

If you want to create a new plugin here, go to your project root directory, run
the command `yarn backstage-cli create`, and follow the on-screen instructions.

You can also check out existing plugins on [the plugin marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)!
